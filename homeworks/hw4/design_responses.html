							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I've learned that color accessibility is very important because it enables people with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies to
								interact with website the same way as those who don't have. I've also learned that when implementing things like button, we should check the contrast ratio.
							    I have also learned that we should not solely rely on color, when implementing things like system warning, we should incorporate appropriate message.
							</p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like that this article provides some links to help us learn more about the topics. I also like that it provides examples of 
								a website does a good job about Colorblind-Friendly mode. In addition, I like that it talks about some law that enforce color accessibility 
								in certain scenarios.
